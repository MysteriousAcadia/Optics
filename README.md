# 8th Wall XR Demo App

# Overview

This sample application contains a simple scene consisting of a TV sitting on a table. The scene comes preconfigured with all of the 8th Wall XR controller scripts
attached to the appropriate game objects.  Simply install 8th Wall XR and build!

If you want to learn how to setup the scene yourself, please take a look at the full [Tutorial](https://github.com/8thwall/xr-unity/tree/master/projects/8thWallXR-Tutorial)

The app shows how 8th Wall XR can:

* Control the position and rotation of the camera in the scene as you move your device in the real world by adding an **XRCameraController** to the camera.
* Capture camera input and use it as the **background** of the scene by adding an **XRVideoController** to the camera.
* Capture camera input and use it as a "live" texture on the TV Screen by adding an **XRVideoTextureController** to the TV Screen.
* Adjust the intensity of the scene light based on the lighting conditions in the world around you by adding an **XRLightController** to the light.
* Place the table onto a detected surface by adding an **XRSurfaceController** to the table.

**NOTE**: This project was created with Unity **2017.1**. If you are on an older version, it should still work, however the textures might not appear properly.
